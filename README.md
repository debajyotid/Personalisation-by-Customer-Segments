## Case Study: Personalising the customer experience
The aim of this case study is to use data to provide a more relevant and engaging experience for customers. We will look to explore how personalised recommendations could be developed and used to enhance the client's customer experience, based on the data provided.

## Task Overview
Using the provided dataset, our goal is to uncover actionable insights and demonstrate how personalisation can drive value for the client. Our approach will involve data analysis, and will be augmented with practical recommendations that balance technical rigour with business relevance.

## We will focus on:
 - Extracting meaningful insights from the dataset to inform your recommendations
 - Modelling customer behaviour to explore its potential for personalisation
 - Comparing alternative approaches to highlight their trade-offs and suitability for this task
 - Presenting your findings clearly to a non-technical audience while being ready to discuss your technical approach

## Deliverables
A 10-minute presentation aimed at a senior non-technical stakeholder, such as the Head of Marketing, and will include: 
 - The practical implications and business benefits of our findings
 - Articulate opportunities for using customer data to create personalised experiences
 - Explain how personalised recommendations can improve the customer journey

## Dataset Summary
The dataset includes 100,000 anonymised records with the following fields:
 - CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer (for reference only).
 - Age: The customer’s age.
 - Segment: A behavioural segment based on prior activity.
 - Recency: A segmentation based on the time elapsed since the customer’s last website visit.
 - PriorInterest: Whether the customer previously expressed interest in a specific product (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
 - DidPurchase: Whether the customer purchased the product (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

Each record represents a unique customer and the dataset pertains to one single product. While the product is unspecified, one may consider broader applications across the company’s product range in the provided recommendations.
